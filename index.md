Hi, I'm Matt Zeidenberg. I'm a data scientist, computer scientist,
sociolologist, and writer living in Brooklyn, New York. I have a Ph.D.
in Sociology from the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UW) and another
Ph.D. in Computer Science, also from the UW, as well as a BA in Physics,
from Harvard. I was born in New York City and grew up in Teaneck, New 
Jersey.

I  work at Abt Associates, where I research workforce development and 
education, primarily for federal agencies like the U.S. Department of Labor
and the U.S. Department of Heatlh and Human Services, and sometimes for
private foundations like the Robin Hood Foundation.

Welcome to my personal site.
