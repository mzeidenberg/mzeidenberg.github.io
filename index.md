Hi, I'm Matt Zeidenberg; welcome to my personal web site. 
I'm a data scientist, computer scientist,
sociologist, and writer living in Brooklyn, New York with my wife and 
daughter. I have a Ph.D.
in Sociology from the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UW) and another
Ph.D. in Computer Science (with an emphasis on machine learning and 
natural language processing), also from the UW, as well as a BA in Physics,
from Harvard. I was born in New York City and grew up in Teaneck, New 
Jersey.

I  work at Abt Associates, where I research workforce development and 
education, primarily for federal agencies and private foundations. 
Previously I worked at the Community College Research Center at 
Columbia University (2006-2014) and the Center on Wisconsin Strategy
at the University of Wisconsin (1991-2006).

I also taught introductory computer programming at the University of 
Wisconsin (1985-1991) and authored a book on artificial neural networks
in artificial intelligence. 

These are some of the technologies I have experience with: Lisp, Python, R,
Stata, SAS, SQL (various variants including MySQL), Javascript, HTML,
and LaTeX.
